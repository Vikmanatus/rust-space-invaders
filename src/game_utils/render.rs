// So we need to render the game screen
// For this first version we will stick to the blue background in the terminal and we will draw the map of the game

// Remember that the map of the game is a rectangle constitued by NUM_ROWS and NUM_COLS
// So NUM_ROWS will correspond to the height
// And NUM_COLS will correspond to the width

// To render we need to have an access to the terminal
